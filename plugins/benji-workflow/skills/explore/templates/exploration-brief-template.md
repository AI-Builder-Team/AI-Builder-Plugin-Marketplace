# Exploration Brief: {title}

> Generated by `/explore` on {date}

## Problem Statement

{What are we trying to solve? Distilled from user input and team discussion.}

## Codebase Landscape

{Key findings from codebase analysis — existing patterns, relevant modules, integration points, constraints.}

### Key Files & Modules

| File/Module | Relevance |
|-------------|-----------|
| ... | ... |

### Existing Patterns

{Patterns the codebase already uses that we should follow or be aware of.}

### Constraints Discovered

{Hard constraints: technical debt, API contracts, performance ceilings, compatibility requirements.}

## External Research

{Approaches, libraries, prior art, and industry patterns explored.}

### Options Considered

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Fit for Our Codebase |
|----------|------|------|----------------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Debate & Challenges

{Key challenges raised by the critic. Assumptions that were tested. Arguments for/against major decisions.}

### Assumptions Tested

| Assumption | Verdict | Evidence |
|------------|---------|----------|
| ... | ... | ... |

### Risks Identified

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|

## Convergence

### Recommended Approach

{The approach the team converged on after debate, with rationale.}

### Open Questions

{Questions that need human decision or deeper investigation during /research.}

### Suggested Scope

{Rough sense of size — how many specs, what the natural decomposition boundaries might be. NOT a formal decomposition (that's /research's job).}

## Raw Teammate Findings

{Optional: abbreviated notes from each teammate for traceability.}
