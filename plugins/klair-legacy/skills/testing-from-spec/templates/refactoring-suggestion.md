# Refactoring Suggestions for Better Test Coverage

## File: [filename]

### Current Issues
- [Issue 1: e.g., "Tightly coupled to external API"]
- [Issue 2: e.g., "Business logic mixed with I/O operations"]
- [Issue 3: e.g., "No error handling for edge cases"]

### Suggested Refactoring

#### Option 1: [Approach name]

**What to change**:
```[language]
// Before
[current code snippet]

// After
[refactored code snippet]
```

**Benefits**:
- [Benefit 1: e.g., "Pure function becomes easily testable"]
- [Benefit 2: e.g., "Separates concerns"]

**Test coverage impact**:
- Can now test [specific logic] without mocking [external dependency]
- Estimated new test cases: [number]

**Effort**: [Low/Medium/High]

#### Option 2: [Alternative approach name] (if applicable)

**What to change**:
```[language]
// Before
[current code snippet]

// After
[alternative refactored code snippet]
```

**Benefits**:
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

**Test coverage impact**:
- [Impact description]
- Estimated new test cases: [number]

**Effort**: [Low/Medium/High]

## Recommendation

[Your recommendation with reasoning]

**Proceed with refactoring?**
- **Yes**: I'll implement [Option X], commit the changes, then write tests
- **No**: I'll skip refactoring and write tests for current implementation where possible
